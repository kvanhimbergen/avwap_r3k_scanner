      Liquidity is a prerequisite. Instruments must support clean execution
      during regular trading hours without excessive slippage. Overnight-only
      liquidity or structurally thin names are avoided.

      Structure is required, but direction is not. Instruments may be trending,
      ranging, or basing. This filter exists only to avoid names that do not
      respect price structure at all.
